Instructions for installation
-----------------------------

These instructions should be valid for most GNU/Linux and UNIX-like
systems.

You will need to have a 'make' program, an 'install' program and
a C compiler installed on your machine.

First, configure the installation in the 'config.mk' file. Then
run 'make' followed by 'make install' to install the program on
your computer.
